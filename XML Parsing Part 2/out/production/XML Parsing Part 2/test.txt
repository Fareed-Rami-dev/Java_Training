Wikipedia is a free, web-based encyclopedia that is written and maintained by volunteers from around the world. It was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.

The content on Wikipedia is created collaboratively by a community of users known as Wikipedians. Anyone with internet access can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles, except in certain protected pages.

Wikipedia is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization based in the United States. The platform supports dozens of languages and is one of the most visited websites globally.

While Wikipedia is a valuable resource, it is not considered a primary source and should be used alongside other references for academic or professional research.

The goal of Wikipedia is to provide free access to the sum of all human knowledge.
